This vhall is cryptography chall.
After we click on the `paragraph` button, we saw the hidden text there.
Because we cannot copy directly from hidden text. we need to unhide it using `ctrl+shift+h`

Then, we decode it using cyberchef by convert the cipher text to binary using `substitute` cryptography and then convert it to plaintext.
