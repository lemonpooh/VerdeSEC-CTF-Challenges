hints for 2nd part: 
1. `file filename.txt` we know that it is a ssh RSA private key file.
2. use the command $` openssl rsa -in <encrypted_private.key>  -out <decrypted_private.key>`
3. well it will need a passphrase
4. we dont know the passphrase, so we crack it using John the Ripper tools
5. **command:** from this [website](https://medium.com/the-padlock/cracking-ssh-private-key-passphrase-459ba17e8d5d)
6. after we found the passphrase, thats the flag for the passphrase! Adding `_` to seperate the password string and submit the flag with correct format `THS{}`.
