The flag is hidden top header and is invisivle, so we need change the color of the text.

So, we get an encoded/encrypted cipher.
probably, I did not know what it is so we put it into cyberchef.
If the cyberchef couldn't detect it, then it probably is MD5/SHA hashing.

so, after we decrypted it using crackstation site cracking tools. we got the first part of the flag.

then we also check on footer.

place it to cyberchef, try all possible base.

we also can check for hidden content by clicking the paragraph button.
then, we also can see there is another encrypt hash. From here I know that I have no patient for this challðŸ˜« to guess all possible flag!too stressy ..sorry, lets continue.

next, uncrop 2 image.

lazy people can use [OCR](https://www.onlineocr.net/) tools to extract the text from the image.
then decode it using cyberchef which we know that it is base64, if you dont know can use the magic pen ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59368650/138414611-2d4915f3-c9f0-4b01-b0f5-39cb9d666640.png)

next part,

last part,
```
reference > manage source > follow the red arrow
```
it is an encoded url,decode it using cyberchef with urldecode we get last part of the flag.

I know person who did this writeup probably have no passion anymore, no doubt as me.ðŸ˜ž
N0TE that sometimes, the flag might be grammar mistake, we need to change it by ourself. hv fun
