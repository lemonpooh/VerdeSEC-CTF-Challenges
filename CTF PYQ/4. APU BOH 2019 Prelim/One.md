`echo "tw0"  >numberofgap.txt` is every 2 characters are gaps

`echo "thr33" >trash.txt` and every 3rd character is thrown to trash. At 1st, i also confuse why using `trash` instead of `keep`? haha

And the `flag.txt` was truely a trash. haha

3rd step: so after we throw every 2 characters away and keep every 3rd character. we got flag!

Flag is hidden here: `a}yp0{udobnxozwhq923401617999#{}[U&A_'%s7d0*3_!~p9`@von^?d<oA>.I2Z}`
